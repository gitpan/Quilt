		   A Perl 5 module for transforming
		  and formatting SGML/XML documents.

WARNING

    This is an early alpha!

    Though, while this may be an early alpha it's only because I had a
    brainstorm on how to handle the transformations -- I will be
    ``porting'' my existing work to this framework and should have a
    much more complete system in less time than one would normally
    expect.

    The areas undergoing a large amount of little changes are the
    details of formatting and features of the Doc Objects (DO).  The
    areas that are likely to change in big ways are the command line
    utility, file and entity handling, helper-functions for hiding
    most of the nitty-gritty of specs and transformation sequences,
    subclassing styles and browser support, formatting options, and
    further out, the language Specs are written in.

INTRODUCTION

    Quilt is a framework for loading SGML/XML documents or document
    fragments, manipulating them in interesting ways, and displaying
    or formatting them.

    Quilt can also be used from code to generate document-like items
    before formatting them -- tables for example.

    There are specs for reading DocBook, LinuxDoc, and TEI Lite
    documents, and formatters for plain Ascii and HTML (mostly 2.0).
    There's a quick and dirty frontend script for formatting
    documents.

    Quilt was formerly called Generalized Document Objects (GDO) and
    DTD Fragments.

    See the file Changes for user-visible changes.  See the `examples'
    directory for examples of using `Quilt'.

    Newer versions of this module can be found at
    <ftp://ftp.uu.net/vendor/bitsko/gdo/>.

OVERVIEW

Formatting Documents

    Before formatting documents, make sure you have the catalogs for
    all DTDs, SPGrove's Simple Spec, and the ISO Entities in
    SGML_CATALOG_FILES, for example:

        export SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/lib/sgml/docbook.2.2.1/CATALOG\
        :/usr/lib/sgml/linuxdoc-1.5/linuxdoc.cat\
        :/usr/lib/sgml/teilite-1.6/teilite.cat\
        :/usr/lib/sgml/iso-entities-8879.1986/iso-entities.cat\
        :/usr/lib/sgml/SGML-SPGrove-0.08/catalog

    A simple test to make sure everything is going to work is to run
    `nsgmls' on your document:

        nsgmls MYDOCUMENT

    Here is the synopsis for using the `tmpfront' script:

        tmpfront { --docbook | --linuxdoc | --teilite }
            { --html | --ascii }  [ --debug ]  DOCUMENT

    For now, this will format DOCUMENT to either HTML or Ascii and
    output on stdout.  `--debug' provides timing statistics.
    `tmpfront' expects to be run from the source directory.  See
    INSTALLATION below for variables to modify in `tmpfront.sh'.

The Process

              (4)         (5)              (6)          (7)
    document  -->  grove  -->  docobjects  -->  format  -->  write
               |           |                |            |
            SPGrove      input          toFORMAT     wrFORMAT
                        spec(1)          spec(2)      spec(3)


     1) load input spec (docbook, linuxdoc, teilite)

     2) load toFORMAT spec (format phase one)

     3) load wrFORMAT spec (format phase two)

     4) load document into grove

     5) transform document into doc objects (DO)

     6) transform DOs into general flow objects

     7) transform general flow objects into output

    (5), (6), and (7) are all performed with ``builders''.  A builder
    is a Perl class that uses visitor functions on it's input to
    transform the input to the output.  Most builders are generated
    from spec files (See SGML::Simple::Spec).

    The transform from document instance into DOs is almost
    one-to-one.

INSTALLATION

    Quilt requires Perl 5, James Clark's SP, SGML::SPGrove,
    Class::Visitor, Class::Template, Text::EntityMap, and DTDs for the
    documents you want to transform.  I'm working on getting most of
    that into one install :-).

<http://www.perl.com/>
<http://www.jclark.com/>
<ftp://ftp.uu.net/vendor/bitsko/gdo/>
<ftp://ftp.uu.net/vendor/bitsko/entity-map/>
<ftp://ftp.uu.net/vendor/bitsko/sgml-toolbox/>

    After you get all that installed, modify the paths in `tmpfront'
    so it can find any libraries not installed in Perl's normal spot
    and point `$specs_dir' to Quilt's `specs' directory.

    Quilt installs with just a Perl install:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
